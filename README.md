Basic project to calculate taxes and totals of items

There are a variety of items for sale at a store. When a customer purchases items, they receive a receipt. The
receipt lists all of the items purchased, the sales price of each item (with taxes included), the total sales taxes for
all items, and the total sales price.
Basic sales tax applies to all items at a rate of 10% of the itemâ€™s list price, with the exception of books, food, and
medical products, which are exempt from basic sales tax. An import duty (import tax) applies to all imported items
at a rate of 5% of the shelf price, with no exceptions.
